# Design-Patterns-CPP
Design pattern implemented types are: Structural, Creational, and Behavioural. (=Relations between classes, Creational of objects, Changes at runtime).
Added explanations, prevented circle of hierarchy in composite DP.

Stractural:
class_adapter,
object_adapter,
bridge,
composite,
decorator,
proxy

Creational:
Factory,
abstruct_factory,
prototype,
singelton,
builder,
builder_immutebale_object + IOC (=inversion_of_control - user control)

behavioral:
observer,
state

(not implemented but important:
Stractural: Flyweight
Behavioural: Command, strategy, iterator, interpreter).

To my own use if ever needed,
added two files, first one with some example of STL (Standard Template Library) usage,
the second contains the implementations of CCTOR (copy constructor) and the like.
