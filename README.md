# Design-Patterns-CPP
Design pattern implemented types are: Structural, Creational, and Behavioural. (=Relations between classes, Creational of objects, Changes at runtime).
Added explanations, prevented circle of hierarchy in composite DP.

Structural:
class_adapter,
object_adapter,
bridge,
composite,
decorator,
proxy.

Creational:
Factory,
abstruct_factory,
prototype,
singelton,
builder,
builder_immutebale_object + IOC (=inversion_of_control - user control).

Behavioural:
observer,
state.

(not implemented but important, a reminder:
Structural: Flyweight (save memory by pointing to an already existing instance),
Behavioural: Command (encapsulation, and save commands to later use), strategy (change algorithm behavior at runtime), iterator, interpreter(used with language/math understanding)).

To my use if ever needed,
added two files, the first one with some examples of STL (Standard Template Library) usage,
the second contains the implementations of CCTOR (copy constructor) and the like.
