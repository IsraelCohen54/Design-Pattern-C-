# Design-Patterns-CPP
Design pattern implemented types are: Structural (Relations between classes), Creational (Creational of objects), and Behavioural (Changes at runtime).
I have added explanations and circle prevention in the hierarchy at composite DP.

Structural:
class_adapter,
object_adapter,
bridge,
composite,
decorator,
proxy.

Creational:
Factory,
abstruct_factory,
prototype,
singelton,
builder,
builder_immutebale_object + IOC (=inversion_of_control - user control).

Behavioural:
observer,
state.

(not implemented but important, a reminder:
Structural: Flyweight (save memory by pointing to an already existing instance),
Behavioural: Command (encapsulation, and save commands to later use), strategy (change algorithm behavior at runtime), iterator, interpreter(used with language/math understanding)).

To my use, if ever needed,
added two files, the first one with some examples of STL (Standard Template Library) usage,
the second contains the implementations of CCTOR (copy constructor) and the like.
