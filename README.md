# Design-Patterns
Design pattern implemented types are:<br>Structural (relations between classes),<br>Creational (creating objects),<br>Behavioural (allowing changes at runtime).<br>
I have added explanations and circle prevention in the hierarchy of Composite DP.

Structural:<br>
Class Adapter, Object Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Proxy, <br>
Flyweight (python, unfinished project for milions of objects, main flyweight concept implemented and used successfully).<br>

Creational:<br>
Factory, Abstruct Factory, Prototype, Singelton, Builder,<br>
Builder_immutebale_object + IOC (=inversion_of_control - user control).<br>

Behavioural:<br>
Observer, State.<br>

(not implemented but important, a reminder:<br>
Behavioural:<br>Iterator, <br>Command (encapsulation, and save commands to later use),<br>Strategy (change algorithm behavior at runtime),<br>Interpreter(used with language/math understanding)).

To my use, if ever needed: <br>
Added three files, the first one with some examples of STL (Standard Template Library) usage, <br>
the second contains the implementations of CCTOR (copy constructor) and the like, <br>
third goes for run time complexity for flyweight project.
