# Design-Patterns-CPP
Design pattern implemented types are: Structural (relations between classes), Creational (creating objects), and Behavioural (allowing changes at runtime).
I have added explanations and circle prevention in the hierarchy of Composite DP.

Structural:
Class Adapter,
Object Adapter,
Bridge,
Composite,
Decorator,
Proxy.

Creational:
Factory,
Abstruct Factory,
Prototype,
Singelton,
Builder,
Builder_immutebale_object + IOC (=inversion_of_control - user control).

Behavioural:
Observer,
State.

(not implemented but important, a reminder:
Structural: Flyweight (save memory by pointing to an already existing instance),
Behavioural: Command (encapsulation, and save commands to later use), Strategy (change algorithm behavior at runtime), Iterator, Interpreter(used with language/math understanding)).

To my use, if ever needed:
Added two files, the first one with some examples of STL (Standard Template Library) usage,
the second contains the implementations of CCTOR (copy constructor) and the like.
