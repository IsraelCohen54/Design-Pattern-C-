# Design-Patterns
Design pattern implemented types are:<br>Structural (relations between classes),<br>Creational (creating objects),<br>and Behavioural (allowing changes at runtime).<br>
I have added explanations and circle prevention in the hierarchy of Composite DP.

Structural:<br>
Class Adapter,<br>
Object Adapter,<br>
Bridge,<br>
Composite,<br>
Decorator,<br>
Proxy, <br>
Flyweight (python, unfinished project for milions of objects, main flyweight concept implemented and used successfully).<br>

Creational:<br>
Factory,<br>
Abstruct Factory,<br>
Prototype,<br>
Singelton,<br>
Builder,<br>
Builder_immutebale_object + IOC (=inversion_of_control - user control).<br>

Behavioural:<br>
Observer,<br>
State.<br>

(not implemented but important, a reminder:
Behavioural:<br>Command (encapsulation, and save commands to later use),<br>Strategy (change algorithm behavior at runtime),<br>Iterator,<br>Interpreter(used with language/math understanding)).

To my use, if ever needed: <br>
Added three files, the first one with some examples of STL (Standard Template Library) usage, <br>
the second contains the implementations of CCTOR (copy constructor) and the like, <br>
third goes for run time complexity for flyweight project.
